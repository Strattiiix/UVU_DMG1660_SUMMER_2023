3D Modeling and Surfacing Essentials
My name is Tre Clark. I love gaming and my goal is to be a game developer at Bunige.
I want to work at Bungie because of the work they put into their games. Halo 3 was the first first person game I ever played and Halo Reach is the FPS that really got me into gaming. 
For a long time I was embarrassed about how much I enjoyed videogames. My Father, has always been really tech savvy and kept up with everything that was evolving in the gaming world when I was growing up. Today, It is something we bond over and gaming brings out a joy inside me that I dont get to feel anywhere else. 
That joy and love for gaming is something I want to bring to company with the same standards. I want to make a difference help a company grow by developing games that inspire others just like I was. After doing lots of research and talking with a slew oifcontent creators, game devs and founders of game developers, I have come to the conclusion that Bungie is the best fit for my drive and dreams.
Ironic, that the game that made me passionate about gaming was developed by Bungie.
